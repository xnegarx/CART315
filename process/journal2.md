# Design Journal #1 : Game Analysis

BioShock Infinite, a first-person shooter video game released in 2013, left a lasting impression on me when I played it around its release. The visuals and the setting of the game seemed detached from any specific era and I liked the ambiguity.  While it may not serve as a direct model for the type of game I want to create, its mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses makes it a great foundation for shaping my ideas.

One aspect of the gameplay that I enjoyed was the variety of abilities the player had, such as carrying guns, vigors, and gears. Vigors are exceptionally fun, with eight types, each proving valuable in different situations. The diverse range of creative uses and effects that potions can offer is an aspect I want to explore further. Vending machines scattered throughout the game allowed the purchase of these items with in-game currency. The concept of stations across the map, where the character can obtain useful things, rest, etc, is another idea I'd like to incorporate into my own game.

Furthermore, I appreciate the inclusion of different transportation modes. The use of a sky rail for brief moments in the game added an extra layer of dynamism. Also, inclusion of a companion for the protagonist, depending on the story of the game, could be very useful. 

In terms of crafting a narrative, infinite excels. Its initial vagueness lures the player in and throws them into a whole new reality. The gradual revelation of twists and turns, halfway through the game was both satisfying and impactful. I would like to create a similar device. Adding elements of mystery to the game, by sprinkling hints and clues to foreshadow answers. Additionally, implementing other mechanics such as time travel or time warping.

Infinite is one of the more linear type games, meaning you go from entering a level to straight combat, action scenes, or objectives that are directed at you. I perceive the lack of exploratory possibilities as a missed opportunity. A more open space for exploration and engagement in other activities could have amplified the impact of the mystery.

Moreover,  The game features a number of horde mode battles in which the player must stay alive as long as possible while being presented with increasingly difficult waves of challenges. Although these battles can be frustrating, completing them is ultimately rewarding. I envision incorporating a similar survival test mechanic in my game.

Lastly, I aspire to explore a blend of a point-and-click adventure and an RPG. Drawing inspiration from BioShock Infinite's stylish approach and enigma, but maybe creating a pixelated game with simpler gameplay but an intricate premise.
